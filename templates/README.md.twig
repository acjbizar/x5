×5 (pronounced Times Five) is a simple typeface, constructed from a 5 by 5 grid of squares. This concept is far from new: seasoned Web designers will remember [Kottke’s Silkscreen](https://kottke.org/plus/type/silkscreen/), but examples can even be found in Bauhaus-era tiles. What makes this version different/special, is that the grid is used recursively to construct more complex structures. These structures are self-similar, and behave like fractals in that sense.

{%- for char in ligatures|merge(algorithmic) %}
{% set vars = {'char': char, 'power': i} %}
{%- include "_img.md.twig" with vars -%}
