# {{ name }}

{{ name}} (pronounced Times Five) is a simple typeface, constructed from a 5 by 5 grid of squares.
This concept is far from new: seasoned Web designers will remember [Kottke’s Silkscreen](https://kottke.org/plus/type/silkscreen/),
but examples can even be found in Bauhaus-era tiles.
What makes this version different/special, is that the grid is used recursively to construct more complex structures.
These structures are self-similar, and behave like fractals in that sense.

| Characters | Amount |
| --- | --- |
| Unicode | {{ chars|mb_split()|length }} |
| Non-standard | {{ ligatures|length }} |
| Algorithmic | {{ algorithmic|length }} |

## Sizes

{{ name}} does not work with font sizes in the traditional sense, but rather with exponents. ×5 being the smallest, and ×5<sup>2</sup> (pronounced Times Five Squared) being the next size in line.

In theory there is no upper bound, but I have never gone beyond ×5<sup>6</sup> myself, because the exponential growth makes this impractical for multiple reasons.

{% for i in 1..powers %}
### {{ name }}<sup>{{ i }}</sup>
{% for char in chars|mb_split() %}
{% set vars = {'char': 'u' ~ char|u, 'power': i} %}
{%- include "_img.md.twig" with vars -%}
{% endfor %}
{%- for char in ligatures|merge(algorithmic) %}
{% set vars = {'char': char, 'power': i} %}
{%- include "_img.md.twig" with vars -%}
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}

## Markup

The easiest way to use this typeface on a webpage is by including glyphs as images:

```html
<img alt="A" src="https://x5.acjs.net/images/x5-n<var>power</var>-<var>key</var>.png">
```

…where ``{power}`` represents the number of iterations or size of the image as a number between 1 and 5, and `{key}` represents the character to be rendered.
This is either a Unicode codepoint prefixed with ``u``, or it is the name of one of the special characters.

```html
<!-- Render a capital A at size/iteration 3. -->
<img alt="A" src="https://x5.acjs.net/images/x5-n3-u0041.png">
```

## Installation

{{ name }} can be installed using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```shell
composer require acj/x5
```

This makes all static image files available in the ``dist`` folder, and gives access to the `X5` class that can be used to generate characters.

## Usage

```php
// Render a letter A, based on its Unicode codepoint.
$x5 = new \Acj\X5\X5(0x41);
$x5->parse();
```

```php
// Render an Identicon based on a string, like a username of email address.
$username = 'john-doe';

$x5 = new \Acj\X5\X5('identicon');
$x5->setIdentifier($username);
$x5->parse();
```

```php
// Render a custom glyph based on a binary string, where every 0 represents an empty block.
$x5 = new \Acj\X5\X5('custom');
$x5->setInput('1111110001101011000111111');
$x5->parse();
```
