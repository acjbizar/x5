# {{ name }}

{{ name}} (pronounced Times Five) is a simple typeface, constructed from a 5 by 5 grid of squares. This concept is far from new: seasoned Web designers will remember [Kottke’s Silkscreen](https://kottke.org/plus/type/silkscreen/), but examples can even be found in Bauhaus-era tiles. What makes this version different/special, is that the grid is used recursively to construct more complex structures. These structures are self-similar, and behave like fractals in that sense.

## Sizes

{{ name}} does not work with font sizes in the traditional sense, but rather with exponents. ×5 being the smallest, and ×5<sup>2</sup> (pronounced Times Five Squared) being the next size in line.

In theory there is no upper bound, but I have never gone beyond ×5<sup>6</sup> myself, because the exponential growth makes this impractical for multiple reasons.

{% for i in 1..powers %}
### {{ name }}<sup>{{ i }}</sup>
{% for char in chars|split('') %}
{% set vars = {'char': 'u' ~ char|u, 'power': i} %}
{%- include "_img.md.twig" with vars -%}
{% endfor %}
{%- for char in ligatures|merge(algorithmic) %}
{% set vars = {'char': char, 'power': i} %}
{%- include "_img.md.twig" with vars -%}
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}

## Installation

{{ name }} can be installed using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).
